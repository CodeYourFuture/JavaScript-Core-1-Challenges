# Log Even Nums

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that prints even numbers from 0 to a given number.

## Instructions

- Open [log-even-nums.js](log-even-nums.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `logEvenNums` function to achieve the following:

    - Print all even numbers from `0` up to the given `nums` argument inclusive.

      - e.g. given the number `6` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

        ```bash
        0
        2
        4
        6
        ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [test.html](test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
