# Fizz Buzz

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that solves the [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) problem.

## Instructions

- Open [fizz-buzz.js](fizz-buzz.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `fizzBuzz` function to achieve the following:

    - Iterate through each number in the given array.

    - If a number is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz" to the console.

    - If a number is evenly divisible by 5 print "Buzz" to the console.

    - If a number is evenly divisible by 3 and 5, print "Fizz Buzz" to the console.

    - Else print the number.

      - e.g. given the following array:

      ```js
      var arr = [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20];
      ```

      - The following should be printed to the console:

      ```js
      13;
      14;
      ("Fizz Buzz");
      16
      17;
      ("Fizz");
      19;
      ("Buzz");
      ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [test.html](test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
