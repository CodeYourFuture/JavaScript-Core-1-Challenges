# Vowel Count

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

## Instructions

- Open [vowel-count.js](vowel-count.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `vowelCount` function to achieve the following:

    - Return the number of vowels present in `str`.

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [test.html](test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
