# Countdown

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that prints all whole numbers from `num` to a given number.

## Instructions

- Open [log-nums.js](log-nums.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `countdown` function to achieve the following:

    - Print all numbers from the given `num` argument to `1` inclusive.

      - e.g. given the number `10` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

        ```bash
        10
        9
        8
        7
        6
        5
        4
        3
        2
        1
        ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [test.html](test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
