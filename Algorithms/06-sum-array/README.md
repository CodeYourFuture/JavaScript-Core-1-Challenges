# Sum Array

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that adds up all the numbers in a given array and returns the total.

## Instructions

- Open [sum-array.js](sum-array.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `sumArray` function to achieve the following:

    - Add all of the numbers in the given `arr` array argument and return the total.

      - e.g. given the following array:

      ```js
      var arr = [3, 1, 5, 6];
      ```

      - The following number should be returned:

      ```js
      15;
      ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [test.html](test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
