# Odd or Even

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that determines whether a number is odd or even.

## Instructions

- Open [odd-or-even.js](odd-or-even.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `oddOrEven` function to achieve the following:

    - If `num` is evenly divisible by 2, return the string "even".

    - If `num` is NOT evenly divisible by 2, return the string "odd".

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [test.html](test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
